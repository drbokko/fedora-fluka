
This is the directory where you should do your FLUKA work. This
directory gets mounted into the Docker container, so changes made here
persist after the container is closed. Anything saved outside of this
directory is lost when the container is removed.

To get started with FLUKA, you begin with the example file:

mkdir test
cd test
cp -r /opt/fluka/example.inp .
$FLUPRO/flutil/rfluka -N0 -M1 example
flair
